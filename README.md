#chatterbox-server
This is a continuation of [chatterbox-client](https://github.com/vtapia5070/chatterbox-client)

This is a chat web application utilizing Ajax, JQuery, Node.js, and HTTP(npm module) to maintain a REST API.

This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta). This project was worked on with a pair.
